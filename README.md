## Project Overview

* Utilized React library to build out various components

* Implemented Firebase for hosting and deployment

React is the V (view) in MVC (Model View Controller) which gives developers great flexibility to show their projects.

Companies like Netflix, Shopify, Airbnb and Facebook (created React) all use react in some capacity.

I'm learning the ease of use with react because of its reusable components which makes developing that much fun.
